# Transverse_Ising_ETH
The Ising model with perpendicular magnetic field, known as the quantum Ising model
is a perfect example of a quantum model than can exhibit various quantum phenomena.
There exist plenty of theoretical methods that have tried to test them all but here
we shall focus mainly on the exact diagonalization techniques for the testing of so
called ETH hypothesis. In order to do this, two schemes of work are introduced. The
first one is focusing on the introduction of the symmetries in the model, while the
consideration of the symmetry sector can be controlled. Secondly, because the model
with translational invariance is creating the degeneracy in the eigenstates, an ETH
is impossible to be tested without symmetry sectors. To deal with it, perturbation 
in the perpendicular magnetic field is introduced. For more information, please ref
